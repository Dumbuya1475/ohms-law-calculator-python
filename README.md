Ohm's Law Calculator in Python

This Python project is a simple yet powerful Ohm's Law calculator, designed to assist in calculating voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in electrical circuits.

## Features:

- Calculate voltage (V), current (I), or resistance (R) by providing the other two values.
- Input validation for numeric values, supporting both integers and floating-point numbers.
- Clear and user-friendly interface, guiding users through the calculation process.
- Modular design, making it easy to understand and extend.

## Usage:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/ohms-law-calculator-python.git
         cd ohms-law-calculator-python
